Overview
    A real time video conferencing system where users join a meeting via a signaling backend, establish connectivity using ICE (STUN/TURN)
Media is end-to-end encrypted on client devices and the backend only coordinates the connection and the media is handled by protocals


Components Used

Load Balancer – routes users to available signaling servers
Signaling Servers – exchange SDP, candidates, session control (join/leave/mute)
Cache (Redis) – store ICE configuration, room metadata, temporary session state
STUN Servers – discover public IP and enable direct peer-to-peer connection
TURN Servers – relay media when direct connection(P2P) fails
WebRTC - capture, encode, encrypt, send and receive media
DTLS + SRTP – secure key exchange and media encryption
UDP Transport – low latency data packet delivery


Process

1. When user joins meeting request goes through Load Balancer to a signaling server
2. Server returns ICE(Interactive Connectivity Establishment) configuration (STUN/TURN info) from cache
3. Clients exchange SDP and ICE candidates via signaling
4. ICE performs connectivity checks
   i) If Direct path works , P2P via UDP
   ii) If Fails, fallback to TURN relay
5. After path selection, DTLS handshake generates encryption keys
6. Audio/Video captured gets encoded and further encrypted using SRTP
7. Media packets flow between peers (servers not involved in media)


Trade-offs

Scales well for 1:1 calls only
TURN relay is expensive and slower compared to P2P
