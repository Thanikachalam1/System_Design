Overview :
    Today I designed a Search Engine system that finds websites based on user search words.

Components Used :

    1. REST API – Takes search request from user
    2. Load Balancer – Sends request to available servers
    3. Search Servers – Process search queries
    4. Redis – Stores frequently searched results
    5. NoSQL DB (Index) – Stores word to document mapping
    6. NoSQL DB (Metadata) – Stores website URLs and details
    7. Web Crawler – Fetches websites continuously
    8. Kafka – Sends crawler data to database

Process : 

    The web crawler tirelessly works 24/7 and fetches the URLs and reads the content in the website all over the internet.

    And the data are stored as word and document_id pair . When we refer document_id in Metadata DB , we will get the actual 
    site's URL and more details which will hepl the ML models to rank them.
