Overview
    A realtime ride booking system where riders request trips and nearby drivers are matched instantly using location indexing. 
The backend coordinates matching,notifications and payments while live driver locations stream continuously.

Components Used

    1. Load Balancer – routes rider/driver requests to available servers
    2. API Gateway – entry point for all client requests
    3. Matching Service – finds best nearby driver using geohash + ETA
    4. Location Service – receives driver GPS updates
    5. Redis – fast lookup of nearby drivers and temporary driver state
    6. Database (NoSQL) – durable trip history and recovery
    7. Notification Service – pushes live updates via WebSocket
    8. Payment Service – charges rider after ride completion
    

Process

    Driver app sends periodic GPS coordinates → API Gateway → Location Service

    Location Service converts coordinates to geohash and updates Redis nearby driver index (and occasionally persists to database 
    ensure durability)

    Rider sends ride request → API Gateway → Trip Service

    Matching Service reads nearby drivers from Redis (current cell and then neighbouring cells)

    Matching Service filters available drivers and temporarily reserves one using Redis lock

    Notification Service pushes assignment to rider & driver via WebSocket  

    Driver continues sending live location updates → Location Service → Redis → pushed to rider via Notification Service

    Trip Service calls Payment Service → Payment Gateway charges rider

Trade-offs

Geohash gives approximate location (not exact location)
Complex system so hard to manage.
Requires locking in redis to avoid assigning same driver to multiple riders.
