Overview : 
    Today I had designed BookMyShow system.

Components Used : 
    1. REST API : For sending request
    2. Load Balancer : For distributing traffic accross the servers
    3. Redis : For checking seat availability quickly
    4. mySql(sharded accross regions) : For storing successful transactions , show timings etc
    5. Kafka : Used as middleman between redis and microservice(sending successful message)
    6. AWS lambda : Used as serverless microservice and it runs only it is called.

Process : 
    The process is very simple , when the user selects seats to book tickets , it will update the
cache(where seat availability are stored) as booked for 5 minutes and the user will be redirected to
the payment gateway.

    After successful payment , it will be sent to queue to hit microservice(send successful message) 
store the successful transaction in the DB.

    If user fails to complete the payment , the seats will be again marked as available.
