Functional Requirements : 
    1. Users can be able to play songs seamlessly.
    2. The recommendation should be based on past activities.
    3. Subscription rules.
    4. Fetch the metadata of the songs.

Non Functional Requirements : 
    1. Should handle millions of requests.
    2. Should handle millions of concurrent plays.

Main components used : 
    1. Load Balancer : Handle the traffic distributing into multiple server instances
    2. CDN : It acts as a cache 
    3. BLOB storage : Best for storing data like images , videos , audio etc
    4. NoSQL database : For storing the metadata of ads and music
    5. Kafka : For sending the data from one microservice to another microservice

Playback Feature : 
    When user wants to play a song , it needs to hit the endpoint which is assigned for playbacks . 
    Then the user is validated whether he/she holds an premium Subscription or not and whether it is a bot or not .

    After successfull verification , the stream URL has been generated with some tokens with some time limitations and returned
    to theuser.

    Then again the user hit the CDN for that song , if the requested song is not present in the CDN (cache miss) , then CDN make 
    a call to the origin (BLOB storage) and get the song and CDN returns the song to the user.


 Recommendation : 
    We get the user's data from microservice and it is evaluated in a certain interval of time like daily basis or 
    weekly basis by the machine learning models.
