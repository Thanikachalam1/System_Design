Tech stack used : 
    1. Load Balancer - For distributing the traffic among the servers.
    2. Redis - For accessing the data faster.
    3. graphQL - To scale accross multiple platforms.
    4. noSQL - For storing the adjacency list of the graph(stores the ID).
    5. mySql - For storing the actual data of the users.
    6. Kafka - For sending the data from microservice 


Process : 

    In general , if two users are connected , then there will be a edge between the vertices(node ie user)
    
    We used graphQL API instead of REST API because REST API struggles with cross platform applications.

    User1 -> User2 -> User3

    Here User1 is connected with User2 and 
    User2 is connected with User3

    So User1 will get recommended to connect with User3 and vice verca.

    The graph is represented as adjacency list and it is stored in noSQL database.

    In noSQL database , we don't store the actual data of the user , we only store the IDs of the user and the actual data is stored in 
    mySql database.

    
    First we check the redis cache , if it miss , then the database will be hitted and the data will be
    stored in the redis and it is accessed via redis .

    We get the adjacency list and all other data from microservice .
