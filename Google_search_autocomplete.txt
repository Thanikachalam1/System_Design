Let's design Search Autocomplete Feature

Things to note : 

    The latency should be less than 100ms , so think of caching 

Tech stack required : 
    1. API Gateway - To implement features like rate limiting and TLS
    2. Content Delivery Network(CDN) - Our All-rounder! It acts as edge cache and handles traffic routing 
    3. Load Balancer - To distribute the traffic without crashing the server (microservice)
    4. Microservice - To handle complex logics
    5. Trie - A type of tree where the characters are represented as node . Ideal for Search Autocomplete.


Process : 

    When debouncing i.e user stops typing for a second , the API Gateway will be hit.

    API Gateway ensures the data is encrypted by following Transaction Layer Security (TLS).

    With the help of CDN we can check the edge cache and return if cache gets hitted.

    Otherwise the traffic will be distributed among many instances with the help of Load Balancer.

    Again it checks the Redis for the combination of word .

    If cache gets missed , it reaches Trie which is also stored in main memory for fast reads.

    Then the data will be sent to ranking and filteration process and the user gets the final result.


    Asynchronously the redis (cache) gets updated.

Tradeoffs : 

    Since we focused only on raw speed , there will high memory usage.

    Can't get the most recent recommendations quickly
